Welcome and thank you for purchasing the 'Countryside Farm Props' Asset Pack.

All assets have been created with ease of use in mind. To use the assets just drag and drop the premade prefabs into your scene from the Prefabs folder.
The prefabs all come with the correct material setup, lod's and collision setup for you, so you don't have to do anything and can use them directly.
If you need a specific setup, feel free to adjust the prebabs to your personal needs. 

Included in the package are also two scenes. 
'AssetOverview01' is a collection of all prefabs included in the asset pack, and is intended to give you an overview of all assets. 
'CountrySideDemo' is a fully decorated scene using all the prefabs to showcase what you could be capable of making with these assets.
Feel free to use both these scenes however you like.
